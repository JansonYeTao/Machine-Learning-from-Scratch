# Machine Learning from Scratch

This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and implementing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms from scratch. It emphasizes building a strong theoretical foundation and gaining an in-depth understanding of how ML techniques work under the hood.

Whatâ€™s Inside:
- Classic ML Algorithms: Step-by-step implementation of algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering, and more.
- Mathematical Insights: Detailed breakdowns of the mathematical concepts driving each algorithm, including optimization techniques, distance metrics, and probabilistic models.
- From Theory to Code: Clear and well-documented Python implementations using minimal external libraries (primarily NumPy) to ensure the focus remains on learning core concepts.
- Visualization-Driven Understanding: Intuitive visualizations and examples that demonstrate how models perform and learn from data.
- No-end2end focused: Focuses exclusively on AI & ML techniques and avoids training model from end2end.
