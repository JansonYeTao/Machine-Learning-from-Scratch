    "\n",
    "If we don‚Äôt have dropout, this layer only relay on neurons C & D to transform information to the next layer. So the neurons A & B might be too ‚Äúlazy‚Äù to adjust its weight since there are C & D.\n",

    "If we set dropout = 0.5, then at each epoch, two neurons are dropped randomly. So it is possible that both C and D are dropped, so A & B have to transform information and adopt the gradients weights adjustment. (This make sure learned weight are evenly distributed to existed neuron)\n"
