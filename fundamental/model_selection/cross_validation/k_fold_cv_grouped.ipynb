    "# Grouped K-Fold Split:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept: This is a variation of K-Fold cross-validation that is specifically designed for datasets where data points are organized into groups. The key constraint is that data from the same group should not be split across different folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is grouping important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies within groups: Often, data points within a group are related or dependent on each other. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient data: Multiple measurements from the same patient. If you are predicting patient outcomes, measurements from the same patient should be kept together in either the training or validation set, not split across.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data: Data points in a time series are sequentially related. You might want to group data by individual time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical data: Students within the same school, users within the same company, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing Data Leakage: If you split groups across folds, you might introduce data leakage. The model could learn patterns based on information from the same group in both training and validation sets, leading to an overly optimistic and unrealistic performance estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, identify the grouping variable (e.g., patient ID, time series ID, group ID).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is partitioned into folds based on these groups. All data points belonging to a specific group are assigned to the same fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Fold cross-validation process then proceeds as usual, but using these group-based folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Imagine you have patient data and you want to predict disease risk. If you have multiple visits per patient, you would group the data by patient ID. Grouped K-Fold would ensure that all visits from a sin"
